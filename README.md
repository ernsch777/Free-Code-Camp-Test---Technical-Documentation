1. Drew up the basic body and navbar divs and article structures. Need to get a source of good code technical documentation and start linking up the <p> text next.
2. Spent a lot of time working on centering and layout options with gridbox and non grid/flex options for positioning and centering elements and content. I like a 2 pixel red border to help see the layouts but I might move to a less harsh option soon :) .
3. Finished up the test and challenge today. Pretty straight forward but trying to list out html code within the <code> tags and in different colors is a pain in the. I do not thing I will end up making any pages with a fixed left column that moves to an absolute position at the top for small screens, but you never know.
